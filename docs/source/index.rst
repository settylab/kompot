Kompot
======

Kompot is a Python package for differential abundance and gene expression analysis using Gaussian Process models with JAX backend.

Overview
--------

Kompot implements methodologies from the Mellon package for computing differential abundance and gene expression, with a focus on using Mahalanobis distance as a measure of differential expression significance. It leverages JAX for efficient computations and provides a scikit-learn like API with `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods.

Key features:

- Computation of differential abundance between conditions
- Gene expression imputation and uncertainty estimation
- Mahalanobis distance calculation for differential expression significance
- Weighted log fold change analysis with density difference weighting
- Support for covariance matrices and optional landmarks
- JAX-accelerated computations
- Empirical variance estimation
- Visualization tools (volcano plots, heatmaps, expression plots)
- **Full scverse compatibility with direct AnnData integration**
